This is an implementation of a Golog dialect called prGolog in Mercury.
Contact schwering@kbsg.rwth-aachen.de for details.

The folders:

  prGolog
    Contains the raw prGolog interpreter without support for continuous
    which we move to the basic aciton theories since not all domains
    need it. Domains need to implement the `bat' typeclass.
  domain
    Contains abstract interfaces (typeclasses `obs_bat', `pr_bat',
    `obs_source') that need to be implemented by modules that either
    implement a basic action theory for plan recognition or provide
    access to observations, respectively.
    It also contains the implementation of the car domain with
    continuous change and time (implements `obs_bat' and `pr_bat') and
    provides a consumer-producer-way of storing observations
    (TODO: stuff from cars-server should be moved here)
  planrecog
    Using the aforementioned typeclasses `bat', `obs_bat', `pr_bat' and
    `obs_source', the plan recognition system incrementally executes a
    hypothesis program and merges incoming observations into the program
    to provide an online way of plan recognition.
  lp-server
    Provides a simple stand-alone server for solving linear programs.
    Communication (the objective, constraints, and solutions) is done
    either via TCP or UNIX sockets. The solver is COIN Osi Clp.
  osi
    Provides facilities to solve linear systems of equations. The
    underlying solver is Coin Osi Clp. It is either linked dynamically
    or access via the lp-server.
  cars-server
    TODO
  cars-main
    TODO
  util
    Contains some general helper predicates and functions.
